# Public Printing at AADL

This repo contains the code used to setup the public printing at AADL along with some documentation. 

If you have suggestions for services or offerings please feel free to open an issue or give feedback via our [contact us form](http://www.aadl.org/contactus).

## Overview

All of our public facing printers are Lexmark MFP Mono Laser Printers. Prints and copies are paid for at the main public desk at each location. For color or large format printing we suggest a full service copy shop.

All public stations print to a single cups-pdf queue which integrates with our public computer session manager. Staff can then send the generated PDFs to the printer of their choice when patrons are ready.

Airprint and other patron services such as fax are provided as possible.

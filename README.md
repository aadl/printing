# Public Printing at AADL

This repo contains the code used to setup the public printing at AADL along with some documentation. 

If you have suggestions for services or offerings please feel free to open an issue or give feedback via our [contact us form](http://www.aadl.org/contactus).

## Overview

All of our public facing printers are Lexmark MFP Mono Laser Printers. Prints and copies are paid for at any public desk.

All public stations print to a single cups-pdf queue which integrates with our public computer session manager. Patrons or staff can then send the generated PDFs to the printer of their choice when they choose.

Airprint and other patron services are provided as possible.
